# Unit Conversion Website

> I applied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design a website that does certain unit conversions 
  such as Celsius to Fahrenheit, Kilograms to Pounds, and Kilometers to Miles. This website was 
  created as a lab assignment for the [Introduction to Web Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer) 
  course offered by IBM (which is course 2 of the IBM Full Stack Developer Professional Certification Program).
